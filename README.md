# 🗄️ MiniDB-Core

## Mission

We're building a **Key-Value store database from scratch** to understand how databases work under the hood. This project is our journey into the fundamentals of data storage, retrieval, indexing, and persistence.

By implementing core database concepts ourselves, we'll learn:
- How data is stored and organized on disk
- How indexes speed up queries
- How transactions maintain data integrity
- How to design efficient data structures

This is more than a project—it's our hands-on exploration of the systems that power the digital world.
